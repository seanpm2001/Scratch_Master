# Soft Micro

[Go back](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Scratch_Master/wiki/)

~~I linked to the wrong version without watching it in this project, and I am sorry.~~ - This was a research error, I looked back and the correct version was added.

SoftMicro is a parody brand name that was adopted by my projects based on a voice edit of Steve Ballmer from the cs188 YTP video: [YTP: Steve Ballmer sells you clean Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T69IS5VGBc). It is a parody name, and was used for many projects, the longest running one being Soft Micro Scratch Error Edition.

Scratch archive
Plan for studios has been made:
* it will follow a similar system to the project list for indexing. There are over 300 studios, so
it will take a while to implement. For external usage, each studio will have its own folder. 
There will be an ID list of 4 things:
=====================
- Comments [ID: B1]
- Projects [ID: C1]
- Curators [ID: D1]
- About [ID: E1]
=====================
:
===>
Comments tab
The comment tab has all the comments for the studio (pretty obvious)
===>
Projects tab
The projects tab will display a list of the projects (MUST include their URL) each one has an ID 
that can be accessed and get info on them (in the future, you may need to turn the original 
projects into functions)
Downloading other peoples project will be on a whole another level. Project thumbnails won't be 
added
===>
Curators tab
The curators tab shows a list of all the curators of the studio. It will include an ID, a link, 
but no profile picture. 
===>
About tab
The about tab shows the info about the studio. It will also include a link to the studios 
thumbnail (internal)
***************************************************************************************************
Your profile
This is actually a really easy task. The profile will have 4 different IDs to navigate:
=================
- Comments [ID: B1]
- Shared projects [ID: C1]
- Liked projects [ID: D1] (don't do this until you archive and index all projects)
- About [ID: E1]
- Following [ID: F1]
- Followers [ID: G1]
=================
:
===>
Comments tab
Comments will be really easy to implement. Just scroll all the way down to the bottom, and select:
* the username of the comments
* the date of the comments
* the content of the comments
Keep the bad comments too, there are bound to be some due to your 1+ year inactivity from the site
===>
Shared Projects tab
Keeps a list of your shared projects. There are over 700 shared projects, so this is going to 
take a while. Keep them in a list here, it will be better organized
===>
Liked projects tab
Keeps a list of all the projects you liked. There are over 1000 projects that you liked, so this
is going to take a while. Keep them in an ID list, along with the project name, and a link
===>
About tab
Shows off your description and about section, and your pinned project. Keep a copy of your activity
log and label the date accordingly. Not much to this step
===>
Following tab
Keep a list of all the accounts you followed. There are over 100, but not close to 1000, so it
shouldn't take too long. Keep them in an ID list, along with their username, and link
===>
Followers tab
Keep a list of all the accounts that followed you. There are over 100, but not even close to 1000,
so it shouldn't take too long. Keep them in an ID list, along with their username, and link
***************************************************************************************************
Helpful tip:
Once you finish archiving a user or project, put it in your bookmarks. Make sure EVERYTHING is 
listed first, like analytics. Make the bookmark organization for your projects similar to the 
main project archive system 
DON'T FORGET TO DO THIS FOR YOUR SECOND ACCOUNT AS WELL!

You should try implementing these ASAP

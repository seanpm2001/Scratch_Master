# About backups

With a particular 2.80x release (version 2.81) my laptop completely froze up while editing, and the only thing I could do to recover the machine was holding the power button down for 10 seconds. I tried waiting half an hour first. Unfortunately, the progress was lost and I had to rewrite it. Luckily I knew exactly how to rewrite the part that was lost.

To prevent this from happening again, starting with version 2.82, separate builds were made as a save state for when the issue did occur, so I could roll back to a recent build. Builds are labeled as:

`A build:` the final version

`B build:` First rollback release

`C build:` Second rollback release

`D build:` Third and final rollback release

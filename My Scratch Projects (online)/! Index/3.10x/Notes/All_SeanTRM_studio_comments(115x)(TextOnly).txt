      Hola a todos. Estoy de vuelta de España . Tuve un tiempo increíble allí. Fuimos a la piscina 2-3 veces al día y fuimos a cenar todas las noches . Mi lugar favouite era llamada la casa de barcos y era muy agradable . Translation: Hello everyone. I am back from Spain. I had an awsome time there. We went to the pool 2-3 times a day & went out for dinner every night. My favouite place was called The Boat House & was really nice. Enjoy the holiday

      sorry about the inactivity for the past few days ive been working on big and awesome scratch projects that take over a week to program at a basis of 6-12 hours a day. hopefully this inactive break will give you the chance to enjoy my other 70 projects. i wont be releasing a game any time soon probably about a week. thank you for all your support and enjoy my work so far :)

i am happy to let you share any of your scratch projects. if you share a project here make sure there is not a check mark next to the draft button. don't worry we will not take your project as our own and we will not let people do changes to any of your projects. and make sure your projects do not contain inappropriate words or else we will take the project down. if we take your project down don't worry you will still own it. we love to see creative minds. don't worry you are very creative, everyone is.

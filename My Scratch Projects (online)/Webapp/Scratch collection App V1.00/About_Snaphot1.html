<H1>About</H1>
<H2>During the very start of Seans programming career, he had to use Scratch as a tool. I really liked Scratch and I spent several hours everyday working on it</H2>
<H2>However, after I reached limitations of the software, and I got tired of using it, I began to do actual programming, especially Python</H2>
<H2>I have worked on Archiving my entire Scratch account, as it has a lot of cool projects, and it is an important piece of my history as it was an early introduction to programming and helped me realize reality</H2>

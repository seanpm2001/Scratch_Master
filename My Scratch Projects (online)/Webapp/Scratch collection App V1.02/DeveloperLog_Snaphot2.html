<p>The start of the Scratch archive project</p>
<p>I have decided to start archiving all my scratch projects. I have attempted this before and gave up quickly. My persistence has gone up significantly, and I am going to try to archive 50 projects a day. If I can do that, I can finish this project by February 9th 2019</p>
<p>I am starting out with just 36 today, as then the rest of the days will be even, as there is a total of 1336 projects on my main scratch account.</p>
<p>Projects archived today:</p>

<H2>Day 5</H2>
<p>I am no longer able to keep up with the pace. I am starting to struggle behind. I was unable to catch up today. It is really stressing me out. There are so many new variables</p>
<p>I wasn't able to do a full 50, I got 18 though</p>

<H2>Day 6</H2>
<p>I was only able to get 12 today. I don't think the February goal is possible now. I am going to need a cooldown period. it has been decided that I reduce the daily project count to 10 instead of 50</p>
<p>This way, I can still get progress, and not stress myself out</p>
<p>Here is what I got today:</p>
<p>0205 | Ocean sandbox 1.1                               |</p>

<H2>January 20th 2019</H2>
<H2>Day 7</H2>
<p>Today was only a catchup day. I didn't get any new projects, except for a duplicate of 'funny scratch moments part 2' which I replaced with 'funny scratch moments part 1' which for some reason was skipped</p>
<H1>January 21st 2019</H1>
<H1>Day 8</H1>
<p>I was able to update the program today to get the first 236 projects in, and fully running. The file size increased tremendously. Why? I don't have a proper Python IDE so I used codeskultpro. When I fixed some revisions and brought it back, all tabs were replaced with spaces. This brought the size up by about 60 kilobytes</p>
<p>I also added a developer log and an update log</p>
<p>I added in 20 projects today, 10 more than required so that I could get it back up to speed again</p>
<p>Here is what I added today:</p>
<p>0217 | Drivers ed 1.0                                  |</p>
<p>0218 | Ocean sandbox 1.1.3.4                           |</p>

<H2>Day 9</H2>
<p>At the new rate of 10 per day, it is going to take a lot longer to finish archiving all the scratch projects. The original goal of 50 per day would have landed the completion day to be February 9th 2019. Not too far off, but Sean couldn't handle it, as it was an unreasonable amount of data to work with in short periods of time per day.</p>
<p>The new goal is 10 per day, and since it is already at 236/1336, it would take 110 days to finish, making the completion date May 11th 2019. However, it is going to be done sooner than that, as sometimes Sean will do more than 10 a day.</p>
<p>Here are the projects that were added today:</p>
<p>0237 | Party simulator                                                |</p>

<p>0246 | TRM drawing studio 1.1.1.2                                     |</p>
<p>Last night was frustrating trying to get this program to boot again. I had to use my old laptop to slow down the program enough for me to read the error. I don't like how Python only shows the error for a couple frames, then closes. If it could stay open long enough for me to see the error, that would be great</p>
<p>It is saying there is a problem on line 7388, and it makes no sense. The syntax of the line is perfect. The characters are in the right case, indenting is correct, the script is in the right order, there are no extra symbols, it is multiple lines from an 'if' statement. I don't know what it is going on about</p>
<p>Hopefully I can fix it</p>
<p>By the way, it works in codeskulptor, the web python IDE that runs python in your browser. It has no issue there, but when I put it as a hard copy on either of my laptops, it doesn't run</p>
<p>Today, I added a lot of chunks and variables to the project as well, along with some updated view, like, and favorite analytical data. The variable chunks look extremely complex and unreadable, so I broke down the simple process into pseudocode</p>

<H2>Day 10</H2>
<p>I am back to doing this at a steady pace again. I am mostly working on sprucing up index features around the projects while still getting the daily 10. Here are the projects that were added today:</p>

<p>Today a new feature was embedded into the program, a copy of the General Public License version 3.0. It will be embedded in all new versions from today onward</p>
<p>Today, a milestone was reached: 10,000+ lines of code</p>
<p>This is a very advanced index, it almost has more lines of code than the first version of Linux</p>
<p>As of Index build 1.85 there is now more lines of code here than in version 0.1 of Linux</p>
<p>A lot of new data has been added in today, hundreds of kilobytes, thousands of lines. The program is getting closer to completion every day</p>
<p>A lot of new builds came out, there will now be a cooldown on build releases</p>

<H2>Day 11</H2>
<p>No progress was made today as I had a sick day today. I spent the day recovering from a stomach bug</p>
<H2>January 25th 2019</H2>
<H2>Day 12</H2>
<p>I am starting to work on the project again today. I am going to try and make up for what I didn't get to do yesterday. The virus lost the battle</p>
<p>Here are the projects I added today:</p>
<p>Nothing was added as I was out of focus</p>

<H2>Day 13</H2>
<p>I attempted to get something done today, and I succeeded. I finished the variable list and added a few projects. Here are the projects that I added:</p>

<H2>January 27th 2019</H2>
<H2>Day 14</H2>
<p>I made a little error today and got 11 projects instead of 10 for the first project run</p>
<p>Here are the new projects from today:</p>

<p>I am still on the road to the May 11th 2019 deadline, hopefully sooner. The project is coming along well, but notepad++ is starting to show signs of lag, which normally means crashing, so I have to be more careful about what I add</p>
<p>As of a little later in the day, I got 9 more projects in, 20/10 of today's goal. If I continue at the 10 rate now, I can finish by May 10th 2019. I will work on reducing the deadline date while going for it. Here are the other 9 projects I added:</p>
<p>0298 | Slot machine 1.0 copy                                          |</p>

<H2>Day 15</H2>
<p>I added 10 new projects this morning, meeting the daily goal early:</p>

<p>Later in the day, I added in 10 more projects, improved the index, and added in 3 new stories</p>

<H2>Dsy 16</H2>
<p>I started out with 7 projects this morning, its all I had time for before school</p>
<p>0327 | Five Nights at Freddy's 2 Game!!!  remix copy                  |</p>

<p>Later in the day, I mean a lot later than usual, I went and downloaded 3 new projects. I ran into a severe error:</p>
<p>Scratch 3 has really gone downhill. I used to easily run this project with less than 2 gigabytes of RAM, but now it takes 20 minutes to load with 8 Gigabytes of RAM. I had to put my computer into sleep mode, and when I </p>
<p>turned it back on, it took 30 seconds even for the screen to come on, then another 2 minutes to log in, then 7 minutes for the project to load, a script on the site crashed, and I had to wait another minute to download it. </p>
<p>Sorry about the rant, I just think this is wrong. If my NEW computer can't run projects easily, then imagine all the kids who use this software with their older cheaper computers? </p>
<p>Luckily, some nice people on Github managed to make a remake of Scratch 3 (open-source too) and I support it. It still has many issues, but I believe that it will work in the end</p>
<p>Here is the link to the original project: https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui</p> <!-- Whoops (no research :/) (I am a little mad at myself over this) !-->
<p>Here are the other 3 new projects from today, I didn't go for the extra 10, just enough to meet the goal. I was busy with other projects today: </p>

<H2>Day 20</H2>
<p>I spent most of my project time working on my website today, so I didn't go for all 20 on the scratch archive project. While I worked on this archive today, I ran into a frustrating error where I couldn't figure out of I did 10 projects or not since the lasting didn't seem to be adding up. It got sorted out and fixed</p>
<p>Here are the 10 projects I added today: </p>
<p>0367 | Kirbys adventure remix                                         | # 1</p> <!-- I am going to keep these Python comments in, even though they are almost irrelevant and completely uneeded !-->

<H2>Day 27</H2>
<p>If I would have kept with my 50 Project a day idea, I would have finished today. Glad I didn't take that route. That would be WAY too stressful. Today is the 27th day of development, and in celebration of a failed product deadline, I have hidden a single character in this entire script that shouldn't be there. I am willing to give out $100 to the first person who finds and reports it to me. Out of the million+ characters and 20000+ lines, the character is pretty hard to find. I am not saying it is impossible, but t will take a long time to find</p>
<p>I added in 10 new projects today to keep the ball rolling. Here is what I added today:</p> 
<p>0437 | Super Scratch Brothers demo                                          |</p>

Day 33
Today was another good day in archiving all my scratch projects, except for one huge issue: untitled-60 just won't download
I keep trying, but it won't let me open the project page to download, it just crashes. Hopefully it gets fixed and isn't a common error for the rest of the archival project today.
Even though it is an empty project, it is still important for the archive
Besides untitled-60, here are the projects I added today:

Day 34
Yesterday was a very bad day in development. I only got 9 out of 10 projects, I made a minor error on the index, and I came across a dangerous glitch that can and is affecting this archive project as a whole
I keep trying, I have the tab pinned, but every reload, even today, that one project keeps crashing. I am going to give it some time before reporting to scratch and I am NOT going to give up on making sure that I have every one of the 1336 projects on my hard drive
I was so stressed out by it today, that I almost forgot to do it entirely. Later in the day, I did it. Today, I added these projects (all 10 work fine, no errors with projects today):
0507 | turkey videos                                                        |

Day 37
My laptop has been getting worn in from a little bit of heavy usage from the past 2 days, and there is a plastic burning smell. At the time, I am being told that this is OK, and that it is just getting worn in, and it means that it is working/
Due to the incredibly slow downloading speed of Soft Micro scratch 2.02 beta, time was limited this morning, and I was only able to add in a few projects of my choice.
There was a statement in a remixed project about how much all my projects take up together, and it was surprisingly close. Currently, the project count is a little over 2 gigabytes, but this guess was within a 1 gigabyte range. I am impressed by the foreshadowing
I was only able to add these projects this morning: 
Funny cats. remix
Submarine simulator 1.00
Soft-Micro scratch 2.02 beta
soft micro scratch 1.00 beta
I will add in more later when I have time
During my lunch break, I added the other 6. Now I am done with this for the day.
Here are all the projects I added today: 
0537 | Submarine simulator 1.00                                             |
0538 | TRM learning academy                                                 |

Day 38
There was a 2 hour delay at School today, so I had extra time for all my projects. I also added 10 items to the index of this project for today. Here are the projects I added today: 
0547 | soft micro scratch 1.01 beta                                         |

Also, I added the original softMicro video into the resources folder of the scratch archive. It is a YouTube poop from cs188 that gave me the name SOFTMICRO which I used all over MANY projects. I could have came up with it myself, but I heard it from him first, and he thought of it over 5 years before me

Day 39
Back at school again today, no delays, no cancellations, but a huge messup with my time schedule. I was trying to get downloads ready for this project so that I have less work to do for the next 2 days, as I am going to spokane. Problem is, the current projects are very resource-heavy, so I spent over an hour downloading 24 projects and not indexing any. It took me a while.
I began to make an organization page, but then I realized it would be better just to write it in, so I abandoned that and started working on it plainly in 6th period. I added 10 projects today:
0557 | Windows XP remix                                                     |
0558 | soft micro scratch 3.0                                               |
0559 | Untitled-63                                                          |
0560 | soft micro scratch 1.06 beta                                         |
0561 | Soft-Micro scratch 2.06 beta                                         |
0562 | soft micro scratch 1.07 beta                                         |
0563 | Soft-Micro scratch 2.07 beta                                         |

Today went a lot better than yesterday. I ran into a frustrating error this morning when adding in projects. I sort projects by the 50s, and the most recent folder was at 40 and the 536-586 index was filled. I got a little frustrated, but it was just a few files that were not added in yet.
Today, I added in 10 more projects. Here are the projects I added today:

Day 50
50 days in, and I am making extraordinary progress. I am in 3 day range of reaching the halfway point. I did a small update this morning and added 10 projects to the index.
Literally all the projects today are just Windows startup and shutdown sounds, since I had a Windows nostalgia phase. Despite the projects taking almost no effort, I am really surprised how these projects get hundreds upon hundreds of views
Here are the 10 projects I added today:
0647 | Windows vista shutdown sound                                         |
0648 | Windows 7 shutdown sound                                             |
0649 | Windows 7 startup sound                                              |
0650 | Windows vista startup sound                                          |
0651 | Windows nt workstation 5.0 shutdown sound                            |
0652 | Windows nt workstation 5.0 startup sound                             |
0653 | Windows 8.1 startup sound                                            |
0654 | Windows 8 startup sound                                              |
0655 | Windows whistler shutdown sound                                      |
0656 | Windows 3.1 startup sound                                            |
I am getting very close to the halfway point now, development is going really well
